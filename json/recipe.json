Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon. Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time and place in hot oil to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate. "

Drain well, pressing lightly, then pat dry with paper towels; place in a large bowl. Quarter the onion slices. Stir onion, oil, thyme, salt, and pepper into potatoes. Lightly coat an unheated very large nonstick skillet or griddle with nonstick cooking spray. Preheat skillet or griddle over medium heat. For each cake, scoop a slightly rounded measuring tablespoon of the potato mixture onto skillet or griddle. Press down potato mixture with a spatula to flatten evenly. Cook for 5 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully turn potato cakes (be sure not to turn cakes too soon or they will not hold together). Cook for 3 to 5 minutes more or until golden brown. Place cooked potato cakes on a baking sheet. Keep warm, uncovered, in oven while cooking remaining potato cakes. Repeat with remaining potato mixture, stirring mixture frequently. Makes 8 servings (16 potato cakes)."
