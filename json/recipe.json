For each cake, scoop a slightly rounded measuring tablespoon of the potato mixture onto skillet or griddle. Press down potato mixture with a spatula to flatten evenly. Cook for 5 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully turn potato cakes (be sure not to turn cakes too soon or they will not hold together). Cook for 3 to 5 minutes more or until golden brown. Place cooked potato cakes on a baking sheet. Keep warm, uncovered, in oven while cooking remaining potato cakes. Repeat with remaining potato mixture, stirring mixture frequently.
