Link: https://devinled.github.io/RecipeSite/

I chose this project as I wanted to gain experience in API fetches, and the ability to display multiple results from searchs.

Features include a search function, clear list function, as well as kitchen timer and weight converter for dry and liquid substances.

The data searched will be through a free Recipe API data from https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api
